## Overview

Welcome to the **Prayer Circle** app! This README.md provides an overview of our mission, features, and how to get started with the app.

## Mission

Our mission is to unite people of the Christian faith by fostering meaningful interactions and opportunities for prayer. We aim to create a safe and private space for discussion, emphasizing the importance of community in spiritual growth.

## Features and Functionality

### Inclusivity
- The **Prayer Circle** app is designed for users of all ages.
- Invites are exchanged directly through QR and numeric codes, ensuring a private and secure connection.
- Users have the ability to designate moderators for their Circles, allowing for multiple users to share responsibility of a Circle.

### Intentional Design
- We address the pitfalls of social media by preventing doomscrolling.
- Intentionality is embedded in the design, featuring a **Presence Timer** to monitor app usage.
- Offline features are available, allowing users to take a break from the constant pressure of online presence.

### Diverse Post Categories
Users can make posts in three distinct categories, each with their own respective purpose:

1. **Praise**
   - Post something that you are thankful/grateful. In a world that can seem so negative, we hope that the ability to post Praises and share how God is working in your life will positively impact our users.

2. **Prayer Request**
   - Post a Prayer Request to share areas in your life where you want others to pray for you. This is the core feature of our app, providing a faith community centered around prayer and relationship with our Creator and Provider.

3. **Events**
   - Post and Event to let others in your Circle know when and where you are planning an event. Users can interact with this post, serving as a low commitment RSVP for the post creator to reference.
